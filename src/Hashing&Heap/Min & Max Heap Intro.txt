Heap: It is a complete(where each node other than leaves has two children) binary tree.

Min Heap: where root is min than its all chidren.

					3

        6       8			

Max Heap: where root is max than its all chidren.

					23
			15				19

Some of its common Application: 
1) Find kth largest/smallest element in stream.
2) Find median of running streams of integer.
3) Merge K sorted list.

Ques) Why heap is stored in array?
Ans) Any complete binary tree can easily stored in Array becuase index of each element can be found by 2 * i +1 .
i is the index of root element.
From wiki:
Heaps are commonly implemented with an array. Any binary tree can be stored in an array,
but because a binary heap is always a complete binary tree, it can be stored compactly. 
No space is required for pointers; instead, the parent and children of each node can be found by arithmetic on array indices.
