Heap: It is a complete(where each node other than leaves has two children) binary tree.

A full binary tree (sometimes proper binary tree or 2-tree) is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.
A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

Min Heap: where root is min than its all chidren.

					3
			5				9
        6       8			

Max Heap: where root is max than its all chidren.

					23
			15				19
		6		8		13		10
			

Some of its common Application: 
1) Find kth largest/smallest element in stream.
2) Find median of running streams of integer.
3) Merge K sorted list.

Ques) Why heap is stored in array?
Ans) Any complete binary tree can easily stored in Array becuase index of each element can be found by (2 * i +1) & (2* i + 2).
i is the index of root element.
From wiki:
Heaps are commonly implemented with an array. Any binary tree can be stored in an array,
but because a binary heap is always a complete binary tree, it can be stored compactly. 
No space is required for pointers; instead, the parent and children of each node can be found by arithmetic on array indices.
