1. What kind of problems be solved using DP?
There are two categories of problem.
a: Optimization : maximum, minimu, longest, smallest, least, most
b: Overlapping Subproblem: Reuse the sub result to solve main problem
eg: Longest palindrome Subsequence
Longest Common Subsequnce
Min Edit Operation

2. To solve a problem with DP, we need to think of brute force approach.
Then try to identify repeating steps.
And store the result of repeating steps in matrix.

3. Note that its not ncessary that DP soution of a problem is always the best.
