A graph consists of nodes/vertex. Edges connect vertexes.
Graph Application: Map, Social Media(To Find connections)
4 Ways to Represent Graph

1) Adjacency List : List<Edge> graph[v]. Graph array size is equal to the vertex. Each index contains a list of neighbours.
Space Optimized as we only store neighbours and the time complexity to find neighbours is also O(neighbours).
2) 2D Matrix : V * V Matrix. 1 where egde eixts else 0. This is not space-optimized as we are storing v*v and time-optimized as we need to traverse O(V) to print neighbours.
3) Edge List: List<Edge> . This can be used when we need to sort edges. eg: MST. Minimum Spanning Tree.
4) Impcit Graph: Where in question the graph is already given in some form. eg: find the shortest path in a matrix.


Graph : It is represented by HashMap. Map<Int, List<Int>> where key is its vertexes and List of vertexes it is connected to.

eg:
1-2
|  |
3-4

1 -> 2, 3
2 -> 1,4
3 -> 4,1
4 -> 2,3

Note that above graph is undirected graph for a directed graph, we can move in one direction.
PS: Most of the problem in graphs will be solved by DFS(depth first search i.e by traversing throuh node by node in one driection)
