** Prims Algorithm:
** This is used to find Minimum Spanning Tree in a graph.
** This is a subset of graph which is connected and edges are min wegiht.
** This is only possible for undirected weighted connected graph.
** Approach: This is quite similar to Dijikstras where we pick the edge with min wegiht.
** Since graph is connected we can start from any one vertex, we are starting from 0.
** Time Complexity : O(V+E) (log V) . Log v to add/remove from Priotiy Queue
** Space Complexity :O(V)
** Since we connect Eâ‰ˆV
